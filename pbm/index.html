<h1>Private Browsing Mode, Browser Extensions and Type Systems</h1>

<p> All modern browsers now support a &ldquo;private browsing mode&rdquo;, in
  which the browser ostensibly leaves behind no traces on the user's
  file system of the user's browsing session. This is quite subtle:
  browsers have to handle caches, cookies, preferences, bookmarks,
  deliberately downloaded files, and more. So browser vendors have
  invested considerable engineering effort to ensure they have
  implemented it correctly.</p>

<p>Firefox, however, supports extensions, which allow third party code
  to run with all the privilege of the browser itself.  When not in
  private-browsing mode, these extensions are permitted to do anything
  they like...and unfortunately, while <em>in</em> private-browsing
  mode, they are not tecnically prevented from doing anything,
  either. What happens to the security guarantee of private browsing
  mode, then?</p>

<p>We have built a type checker to detect data-leaking actions that
  might occur while the browser is running in private browsing mode.
  To a rough first approximation, this type system is similar to
  the <a href="/adsafety">ADsafety system</a>, in that it blocks
  access to several of Firefox's APIs (e.g., the various ways to write
  to disk, among other APIs).  The essential difference, however, is in
  encoding the extensions' allowable behaviors in public and private
  modes as distinct type environments, so that one type-checker
  suffices for both modes.</p>

<h2>Code and Further Reading</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.brownplt.org/2013/08/19/incognito.html">Our
    blog</a> has a post with more details.  For complete detail, our
  <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~blerner/papers/esorics2013_pbm.html">paper</a>
  is available as well.  Finally, our type-checker is implemented using our
  open-source <a href="/tejas">TeJaS</a> framework, and is available
  on
  <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/TeJaS">Github</a>.  To use,
  edit <code>src/main.ml</code> on line 9 to set <code>module Actions
  = BI.Actions</code>, then build and run as normal.</p>
