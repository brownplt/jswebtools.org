<h2>Mashups and Mashup Security</h2>

<figure style="float: right;"><img src="http://brownplt.github.com/img/adsafety.png" /></figure>

<p> A <i>mashup</i> is a webpage that mixes and mashes content from various
sources. Facebook apps, Google gadgets, and various websites with embedded maps
are obvious examples of mashups. However, there is an even more pervasive use
case of mashups on the Web. Any webpage that displays third-party ads is a
mashup. It's well known that third-party content can include third-party
cookies; your browser can even block these if you're concerned about "tracking
cookies". However, third party content can also include third-party JavaScript
that can do all sorts of wonderful and malicious things (<a

</p>

<p>Is it possible to safely embed untrusted JavaScript on a page? Google Caja,
Microsoft Web Sandbox, and ADsafe are <i>language-based Web sandboxes</i> that
try to do so. Language-based sandboxing is a programming language technique
that restricts untrusted code using static and runtime checks and rewriting
potential dangerous calls to safe, trusted functions.</p>

<p>Sandboxing JavaScript, with all its corner cases, is particularly hard. A
single bug can easily break the entire sandboxing system. JavaScript sandboxes
do not clearly state their intended guarantees, nor do they clearly argue why
they are safe.  <figure style="float: left;"> <img

works.</figcaption> </figure> </p>

<h2>Verifying Web Sandboxes</h2>

<p>In 2011, we embarked on a project to verify <a
href="http://www.adsafe.org/">ADsafe</a>, <a
href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>'s Web sandbox. ADsafe is
admittedly the simplest of the aforementioned sandboxes. But, we were also
after the shrimp bounty that Doug offers for sandbox-breaking bugs:

<blockquote cite="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/caplet/message/44">
Write a program [...] that calls the alert function when run on any browser. If the program produces no errors when linted with the ADsafe option, then I will buy you a plate of shrimp. (<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/caplet/message/44">link</a>)
</blockquote>

We wrote a <a
href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pegk-type-verif-js-sandbox/">USENIX
Security paper</a> on our work.
 The paper discusses the many common techniques
employed by Web sandboxes and discusses the intricacies of their
implementations. (TLDR: JavaScript and the DOM are really hard.) Focusing on
ADsafe, it precisely states what ADsafety actually means. The meat of the paper
is our approach to verifying ADsafe using types. Our verification leverages our
earlier work on <a
href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gsk-essence-javascript/">semantics</a>
and <a
href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gsk-flow-typing-theory/">types</a>
for JavaScript, and also introduces some new techniques:</p>

<ul>

<li>Check out the <span style="font-size: large;">★</span>s and <span
style="font-size: large;">☠</span>s in our object types; we use them to
type-check "scripty" features of JavaScript. <span style="font-size:
large;">☠</span> marks a field as "banned" and <span style="font-size:
large;">★</span> specifies the type of all other fields.</li>

<li>We also characterize JSLint as a type-checker. The Widget type presented in
the paper specifies, in 20 lines, the syntactic restrictions of JSLint's
ADsafety checks.</li>

</ul>

<p>Unlike conventional type systems, ours does not prevent runtime errors.
After all, stuck programs are safe because they trivially don't execute any
code. If you think type systems only catch "method not found" errors, you
should have a look at ours.</p>

<p>We found bugs in both ADsafe and JSLint that manifested as type errors. We reported all of them and they were promptly fixed by Doug Crockford. A big thank you to Doug for his encouragement, for answering our many questions, and for buying us every type of shrimp dish in the house.

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>We verified ADsafe using <a href="/strobe">Strobe</a>, our type-checker for JavaScript. A snapshot of Strobe with type-annotated ADsafe is <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/plt/dl/adsafety/v1/adsafety.tgz">available online (.tar.gz)</a>.</p>
