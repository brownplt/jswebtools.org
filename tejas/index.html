<h1>TeJaS: A Family of Type-Checkers for JavaScript</h1>

<p>Programmers use type systems to prevent errors in their programs,
  but precisely <i>which</i> behaviors should be considered erroneous
  varies from programmer to programmer.  Indeed, the flexibility of
  JavaScript makes it essentially futile to design a <i>single</i>
  type system that is flexible enough for all purposes; instead, we
  need multiple, related type systems that can be customized for each
  programmer.</p>


<h2>Flexible Implementations of Type Systems</h2>
<p>Our implementation takes advantage of OCaml's functor system, and
  provides a <code>Base</code> type system module with typical types
  and typing rules, and hooks for an <code>Extension</code> module to
  extend the <code>Base</code> with new types and typing rules.</p>

<p>The TeJaS system is summarized in our <a
href="http://cs.brown.edu/~blerner/papers/dls2013_tejas.html">paper at DLS
2013</a>.<br>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>We've used TeJaS to implement a <a href="/jquery">type system for
    jQuery</a>, which augments the <code>Base</code> system with new
    kinds for describing the sizes of jQuery collection objects.
</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>TeJaS is open-source and available on <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/TeJaS">Github</a>.</p>
