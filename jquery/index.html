<h1>JQuery-Types: Type-checking jQuery Client Code</h1>

<p>JQuery's APIs allow programmers to select a set of nodes in a
  document, navigate to new nodes (relative to previously-selected
  ones), and manipulate selected nodes.  This API is flexible,
  powerful, and sufficiently different from low-level DOM programming
  that it might as well be its own language &mdash; and can and should
  be analyzed as such.</p>

<p>We have built a type checker to detect <i>query errors</i>, where
  queries return too many, too few, or just unexpected results.  This
  type checker needs to keep track of the <i>sizes</i> of query
  results in addition to their types.  This in turn requires
  developing a sufficiently expressive yet still decidable
  representation of sizes, a representation of &ldquo;local
  structures&rdquo; within the markup, and a sufficient encoding of
  CSS selectors to connect local structures to query types.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Our type-checker is implemented using our
  open-source <a href="/tejas">TeJaS</a> framework, and is available
  on
  <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/TeJaS">Github</a>.  To use,
  edit <code>src/main.ml</code> on line 9 to set <code>module Actions
    = JQI.Actions</code>, then build and run as normal.</p>
