<h1>Static Analysis for AJAX Intrusion Detection</h1>

<p> Back in 2008, the group decided to really understand JavaScript.
Arjun had built a static analysis for JavaScript from scratch. Being the
honest chap that he is, he was forced to put the following caveat into
the paper: </p>

<blockquote> "We would like to formally prove that our analysis is sound.
A sound analysis would guarantee that our tool will never raise a false
alarm, an imporant usability concern. However, a proof of soundness would
require a formal semantics for JavaScript and the DOM in browsers, and
this does not exist." </blockquote>

<p> This paper was our first foray into the world of analysis for real
JavaScript programs.  It inspired work on &lambda;JS and tractable tools
for JavaScript. <a
