title: "LambdaJS"
---

- Felleisen-Hieb style semantics for JavaScript
- Based on the JavaScript specification (i.e., core algorithms come from the
  specification)
  * Example algorithm
- Tested to conform with actual Web browsers (December 2009)
  * Example of test output

- Two pieces: core calculus + desugaring function

- Core caculus
  - fits on three pages (unlike ECMAScript 3rd ed)
    * Fragment of AST from ECOOP paper
  - Mechanized in Coq
    * Same fragment in Coq
  - Mechanized in PLT Redex
    * Same fragment in Redex

- Desugaring
  - 1,000 LOC of Haskell (excluding auxiliary functions, such as the parser)
  - (Mostly) compositional desugaring. (With is definitely not compositional;
    lifting of variable declarations is unusual)
