title: A Model of DOM Event Dispatch
---

<div class="content foundation">

<h1>Modeling and Reasoning About DOM Events</h1>

<p>Web applications are fundamentally reactive. Code in a web page runs in
reaction to events, which are triggered either by external stimuli or by other
events. The DOM, which specifies these behaviors, is therefore central to the
behavior of web applications. We define the first formal model of event
behavior in the DOM, with high fidelity to the DOM specification. Our model is
concise and executable, and can therefore be used for testing and verification.
We have applied it in several settings: to establish some intended
meta-properties of the DOM, as an oracle for testing the behavior of browsers
(where it found real errors), to demonstrate unwanted interactions between
extensions and validate corrections to them, and to examine the impact of a web
sandbox. The model composes easily with models of other web components, as a
step toward full formal modeling of the web.</p>
